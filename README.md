# Programming-Exercises

This repository is to store different algorithm problems and solutions, this is great to improve our programming logic :)

All solutions are in the code.

## Easy

**1. Two sum**

     Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
     You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
 
     Example: 
     Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9 
     Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9. 
     Return [0, 1]

## Medium

**1. Add two numbers**
    
    You are given two non-empty arrays that representing two non-negative integers. 
    The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit.
    Add the two numbers and return it as an array.
    
    You may assum the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
    
    Example:
    Input: [2, 4, 3] + [5, 6, 4]
    Output: [7, 0, 8]
    
    Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807
